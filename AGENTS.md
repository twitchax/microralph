# microralph — Agents Guide

This document provides detailed workflows and troubleshooting for AI coding agents working in this repository.

## Workspace Overview

- `src/`: Main Rust source code
- `.mr/`: microralph state directory
  - `prds/`: PRD files
  - `templates/`: PRD templates
  - `prompts/`: Static prompt files for each stage
  - `PRDS.md`: Auto-generated PRD index

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build
cargo build

# Test
cargo make test

# Full CI (fmt, clippy, test)
cargo make ci

# UAT (the one true gate)
cargo make uat
```

## Build & Test

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install cargo-make (if not present)
cargo install cargo-make
```

### Commands

```bash
# Format code
cargo make fmt

# Run clippy
cargo make clippy

# Run tests with nextest
cargo make test

# Run full CI pipeline
cargo make ci
```

## Conventions for Agents

- Keep changes minimal and focused; avoid unrelated refactors.
- Follow existing style; don't add license headers.
- Use `anyhow::Result` for fallible functions.
- Prefer `tracing` over `println!` for diagnostics.
- All dev commands route through `cargo make`.

### Code Style

- Use vertical whitespace generously to separate logical sections.
- Prefer explicitness over implicitness.
- Reduce nesting by using guard clauses and early returns.
- Prefer functional programming techniques where appropriate.

## PRD Format

PRDs are Markdown files with YAML frontmatter containing:

- `id`: Unique identifier (e.g., PRD-0001)
- `title`: Human-readable title
- `status`: draft | active | done | parked
- `tasks`: List of tasks with id, title, priority, status

History entries are appended by `mr run` at the bottom of the PRD.

## Quick Tasks Reference

```bash
# Format
cargo make fmt

# Lint
cargo make clippy

# Test
cargo make test

# Full CI
cargo make ci

# UAT
cargo make uat
```

## Troubleshooting

- If `cargo-make` is missing: `cargo install cargo-make`
- If `cargo-nextest` is missing: `cargo binstall cargo-nextest --no-confirm`
- For faster tool installation, use cargo-binstall:
  ```bash
  curl -L --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall/main/install-from-binstall-release.sh | bash
  ```

<!-- BEGIN MICRORALPH AUTO-MANAGED SECTION -->
Looking at the completed task T-001, I see the `mr prd finalize <id>` CLI command was added. Let me check the implementation to understand any new patterns or conventions worth documenting.

The implementation follows the existing patterns - using `anyhow::Result`, `tracing` for diagnostics, and `Config`/`Result` pattern for command functions. The task added a new CLI command `mr prd finalize <id>`.

Let me check if there are any new patterns worth documenting in AGENTS.md:

The auto-managed section is indeed malformed - it contains raw prose from a previous update rather than properly formatted content. The T-001 completion adds a new CLI command `mr prd finalize <id>`, but since this is still a partial implementation (only the CLI scaffolding), I should:

1. Clean up the malformed section
2. Add note about the new command pattern (Config/Result structs)

Updated the auto-managed section with:
- **CLI Commands** — documented all available commands including the new `mr prd finalize <id>`
- **Code Patterns** — documented the Config/Result struct pattern, module organization, Runner trait usage, and command handler pattern
